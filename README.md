# Hafiz Abdulmanan
My own coded portfolio website for web development bootcamp
I have coded this website in HTML, CSS, JS
The CSS I have used is SAAS. Working with SAAS variables and functions was great experience. 
The animation of typewriting is coded with the help of JS.
# Future Changes
Right now it is a single page website. In future when i have my own projects i will display it in my website with another page.
I will add more animation. There is a lot more work to be done on styling the layout of the page.
In future i can add a blog page as well.
