# Hafiz Abdulmanan
My own coded portfolio website for web development bootcamp
I have coded this website in HTML, CSS, JS
The CSS I have used is SAAS. Working with SAAS variables and functions was great experience. 
The animation of typewriting is coded with the help of JS.
# Future Changes
I will more bootsrap elements and make more animation in my website. The background will be replaced with nice artistic style which is currenly light black. The animation will provide greater user experience.
